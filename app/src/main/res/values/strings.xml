    <string name="advtText">Vayu Stuti is one of the most famous poems composed by Sri Trivikrama Panditacharya in praise of Sri Madhvacharya, the founder of the Dvaita school of philosophy.It is said that when Trivikrama Panditacharya presented his work, Sri Madhva insisted that the work should not be dedicated to his praise alone and instantly composed the Nakha Stuti and instructed that it be chanted before and after the Vayu Stuti. The Vayu Stuti comprises 41 paras. It is usual practice to chant the Vayu Stuti by starting and ending it with the Narasimha Nakha Stuti, a short two-para composition by Sri Madhva in praise of Lord Narasimha. Hence, it is appropriate to call Vayu Stuthi as \'Sri Hari Vayu Stuthi\'.</string>
